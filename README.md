## Dorothy's Dowel Pins
### Description
In this assignment ine wooden dowel was made. With that one dowel, different configurations were made to control different things such as the length and width.
### Lessons Learned
*Configurations make it easier. Only need one part with configurations instead of multiple of very similar parts.
*By having 4 configurations on both the diameter and length, I can have 16 different pins with a few clicks.
* Using Configurations in assembly
